### CODE EXAMPLE:
Description: The rgb function is incomplete. Complete it so that passing in RGB decimal values will result in a hexadecimal representation being returned. Valid decimal values for RGB are 0 - 255. Any values that fall out of that range must be rounded to the closest valid value.

```
function rgb(r, g, b){
    return toHex(r)+toHex(g)+toHex(b);
}

function toHex(d) {
    if(d < 0 ) {return "00";}
    if(d > 255 ) {return "FF";}
    return  ("0"+(Number(d).toString(16))).slice(-2).toUpperCase()
}
